This is my first blog. So I am a bit nervous. I've given some thought to what to write and in what style. I'm not familiar with blogging and social media in general. So if you have any suggestions, please feel free to share. 

I decided to blog to share my work in data analytics, which I've become so passionate about for the past few years. I want my blog posts to be informal and plan to share brief but interesting data analyses. The code for the analysis can be found in my GitHub account. Click [here](https://github.com/soungl/Entrepreneurial-Activity-in-Lakes-Region).

## Question I want to answer
My first blog is about a project my students did during this past semester. At the beginning of the semester, Jeff Hayes, my old friend and the executive director of the Lakes Region Planning Commission, asked me to consider an economic study as a student project in one of my data analytics courses. The analysis below is one of those student projects I refined and developed further just for fun. The students wanted to examine the level of the entrepreneurial activity in the Lakes Region.

## Data
As a proxy for the entrepreneurial activity, students used town-level (county subdivision, to be more accurate) personal income data from the U.S. Census: American Community Survey, 5-year estimates over 2012-2016. 

Personal income is one of primary sources of data for sub-state level economic analysis along with employment and population. Components of personal income is also useful to study the makeup of the resident population: for example, a high proportion of investment income may be indicative of a high quality of life and thus a large affluent retiree population in rural places like New Hampshire's Lakes Region. See below for the definition of the income variables used in this analysis. All incomes below are aggregated incomes for towns.

* total personal income = labor income + non-labor income
    - labor income = self-employment income + wage and salary income
    - non-labor income = investment income + transfer payment income
        - investment income = interest income + dividend payments + rental income
        - transfer payment income = social security income + welfare + medicare + medicaid. 


Why are they important?
 
* Wage and salary income: An increase in wage and salary income may suggest an increase in the number of jobs, an increase in the proportion of higher-paying jobs, or a combination of both. In all cases, an increase in wage and salary income is positive news.
* Labor versus non-labor income: While an increase in labor income reflects a rise in the economic activity in the area, an increase in non-labor income may not indicate the same. Nonetheless, non-labor income is an important source of income, often for rural communities.
* Components of non-labor income: non-labor income comprises of two sources: 1) investment income and 2) transfer payment income. The ratio between the two may be suggest the makeup of the residents. Towns with a high proportion of investment income in total non-labor income may reflect a large affluent population with property and investment income.



## Where in the Lakes Region do we have entrepreneurs?
Lake Winnipesaukee appears to be the center of the entrepreneurial activity in the Lakes Region with Laconia at the top, followed by Wolfeboro, Gilford, Moultonborough and Meredith. However, Laconia's top rank may just reflect a larger population and may not necessarily mean that the city is more entrepreneurial than other places in the region.
