***Advantages of Customer Review Data:***

Customer review data from social media and online platforms offers
several advantages over traditional market research and industry
reports:

-   **Real-Time Insights:** Customer reviews provide real-time feedback,
    enabling quick responses to emerging trends and concerns. Unfiltered
    Feedback: Reviews reflect authentic customer opinions, offering
    unbiased insights into experiences and sentiments.
-   **Granular Details:** Review data contains specific details that can
    inform targeted strategies, unlike aggregated data in industry
    reports.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Gathering data from existing platforms is
    more cost-effective than conducting large-scale surveys. Contextual
    Understanding: Reviews provide context behind sentiment, aiding in
    understanding the 'why' behind opinions.
