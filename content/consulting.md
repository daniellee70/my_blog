**Testimonials**

Rich Grogan (Executive Director at Northern Border Regional Commission)

> "I've worked with Daniel in several capacities,
> including as a Board member, and now through his essential statistical
> and analysis work in support of the Northern Border Regional
> Commission's (NBRC) efforts to ensure investments accrue to the
> Region's
> most distressed counties. Daniel is incredibly responsive and
> conscientious, and is quick to say what is possible (and what is not).
> He worked with us to effect several last minute changes to the NBRC's
> distress measurements during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic,
> and during that time also served as a statistical thought partner."

Jessyca Keeler (President at Ski New Hampshire)

> "Ski New Hampshire began working with Daniel
> during the summer of 2018 to examine the economic impact of the ski
> industry between the years of 2014/15 through 2017/18 on the State of
> New Hampshire. He brought to the table the most current methods of
> evaluating the industry's impact and was patient, flexible, and
> willing
> to explain how results were determined throughout the entire process.
> We
> will be working with him again on our next study which we hope to
> begin
> work on soon."

Bob Nadeau (Professor, Business Consultant)

> "Daniel is a consummate professional who takes
> initiative and keeps up with the rapidly changing business
> environment.
> He was the driver of using big data and the use of it in academia, and
> in the classroom. He is a subject matter expert and well respected by
> his colleagues and students."

Mark Scarano (Former Federal Co-Chair at Northern Border Regional
Commission)

> "I contracted with Daniel Lee in 2016 to research economic and
> demographic data within the NBRC's service area. He not only collected
> the data we required but also assisted us in analyzing that data and
> identifying trends. I found him very accommodating and a pleasure to
> work with."

Gail McWilliam Jellie (Director of Agricultural Development at the NH
Dept. of Agriculture)

> "Daniel provided an in-depth review and analysis of the economic
> contributions of the agricultural industry in NH for the NH Dept. of
> Agriculture, Markets & Food. The report is an invaluable resource and
> we appreciate Daniel's expertise and availability."
